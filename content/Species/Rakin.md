# Rakin

In secret dens beneath city streets, within the hollowed walls of castles, or amongst thick and unkempt underbrush, the Rakin reside. A reputation of chicanery, earned or not, follows a Rakin through their life, leading them to live out a scorned existence amongst other humanoids, or to isolate themselves with their kith and kin. The masked face of a Rakin is seldom accepted in humanoid society.

Wherever they scamper, be it through moonlit forests or torchlit streets, Rakin have a knack for getting themselves into comically perilous situations. They have a similar aptitude for saving their own hide, unhampered by the destruction they may leave behind. Mischief, whether it be playful, malicious, or unintentional, is the common trait that links all Rakin.

The mistaken spawn of a passionate tryst between deities of trickery and nature, Rakin hold a deep affinity for both domains. Since their creation, they have had little contact with either god, and have learnt to rely on their own wits to survive.

As Rakin society progressed, their culture grew to value trickery and subterfuge above all else. Good-natured pranks sprang from their paws as instinctively as breathing. Honed against the fearsome beasts of the forest, this innate talent to trick and deceive helped the Rakin bloom as a civilisation. Tales are still told of how Gurbo the Wise fought off a rampaging owlboar with nought but a goodberry, a silver needle, and a pig’s bladder.

Rakin politics, religion, and interpersonal relationships revolve around the idea of practical jokes. An atmosphere of one-up-manship and lighthearted merriment suffuses all of their wheelings and dealings. Even when faced with the most horrid of circumstances, a Rakin’s first instinct is to crack a joke.
## Ideological Chasm

After centuries of living in chaotic, mirthful harmony and isolation, the Rakin had their first contact with other humanoid races. As the settlements of humans, elves, and dwarves sprang up along the borders of their ancestral homelands, an ideological battle split Rakin culture in two. 

Many of the Rakin were intrigued by these forests of stone and steel, organized yet unpredictable, and full of opportunity. The elders forbade them to interact, alleging such civilization to be directly counter to the chaos that nature intended, the principle upon which Rakin culture was built.

The debacle spiraled into a full-on feud between the opposing Rakin factions, sundering the once united race into two. The Urkin broke with tradition and followed their ambition into the cities, whilst the Tanukin remained in their indigenous forests, continuing to adhere to their ancestral ways.

## Rakin Names
Rakin naming conventions differ greatly between the Urkin and Tanukin subraces, whose cultural structures irrevocably changed after the schism.

* ***Urkin.*** Eager to fit in, the Urkin quickly adopted the first and last name format of humanoid races. Despite this, Urkin usually end up naming themselves. Typically, an Urkin will take the name of a well known figure, and wring from it the most humorous pun imaginable. Urkin pride themselves on having the cleverest name they know, and will go through dozens in their lifetime.
* ***Tanukin.*** More traditional, and with deeper ties to their ancestry, Tanukin stick to one name over the course of their lifetime. Tanukin regard family with uncharacteristic solemnity. Accordingly, Tanukin names are granted by their parents, a portmanteau of the two names of their caregivers. Because of this, gender plays little to no role in their naming conventions.
## Rakin Traits
Rakin share a number of traits in common with each other.

* ***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 2.
* ***Age.*** Rakin age slightly quicker than humans, reaching adulthood by 14. They live to be around 70.
* ***Alignment.*** Because of their mischievous nature, nearly all Rakin tend toward a chaotic alignment, as they can’t help themselves from getting into some sort of hijinks. Most Rakin are neutral, taught to fend for themselves by a harsh world, but there are the occasional outliers that stray to the side of good or evil.
* ***Size.*** Rakin are between 3 and a half to 4 feet tall. They have a light gait but sturdy frames, weighing from 40 to 90 pounds. Your size is Small.
* ***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
* ***Darkvision.*** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern colour in darkness, only shades of gray.
* ***Deft Climber.*** You have a climbing speed of 20 feet.
* ***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice.
* ***Subraces.*** The idealogical schism that bifurcated the Rakin people led to cultural and physiological changes. Those two subraces are the Urkin and the Tanukin.

### Urkin
Urkin society values cunning, savvy, and – above all – the thrill of the heist. This leaves the Urkin with a bit of a nasty reputation; a fact that utterly fails to curb their ambitions. Adaptable and resourceful, the Urkin embraced humanoid civilization. They excelled as confidence tricksters and pickpockets, quickly gaining prestige with thieves’ guilds and morally-grey professionals. As an Urkin, you’ve likely grown up on the streets, fending for yourself in order to survive and making unscrupulous connections along the way.

* ***Ability Score Increase.*** You increase your choice of Charisma or Intelligence score by 1.
* ***Streetwise.*** You are proficient in the Stealth and Sleight of Hand skills. Additionally, you can understand Thieves’ Cant.
* ***Nimble Dodge.*** When forced to make a Dexterity saving throw against an effect you can see, you can use your reaction to gain advantage on your saving throw. Success or fail, after the effect occurs, you can immediately move up to your movement speed without provoking opportunity attacks. Once you use this ability, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.
### Tanukin
Content to stay in their ancestral homes, the Tanukin fortify their ties to the natural world and the innate magic it grants them. Tanukin delight in using their limited shapeshifting abilities to scare off or otherwise vex interlopers within their sacred forests.

Tanukin believe that civilization is a sacrilegious destruction of the beautiful chaos of nature. So rarely do Tanukin venture into humanoid settlements, that they are often mistaken for racoons, or worse, Urkin. The times they do deign to enter the ‘stone forests’, it is in order to use their illusion magic to evoke the divine chaos and confusion that they associate with the natural world.

* ***Ability Score Increase.*** You increase your choice of Charisma or Wisdom score by 1.
* ***Adept Trickster.*** You have proficiency with the Deception skill.
* ***Tanukin Magic.*** You know the minor illusion cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast _disguise self_ once, and it recharges after a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast _alter self_ once, and it recharges after a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

## Urkin - Urban Artists

Over the centuries, the Urkin spread far across the continents, seeping into almost every major city. Here they adapted to living in society’s margins; skipping between shadows, nesting in abandoned spaces, and ‘borrowing’ that which the ‘tall folk’ left lying around. As the saying goes “What the tall folk don’t see, is the Urkins’ for free.”

If you know where to look, the graffitied symbols Urkin leave in their wake tell unseen stories. A slingshot might mean that the resident will attack Rakin on sight, whilst a wagging tail indicates an easy target for occasional larceny. Knowing how to translate these pictograms can prove a bountiful boon to a rogue in dire need.

## Tanukin - Tribal Travellers

There are certain days of the year that those who live near Tanukin know not to hunt and forage in the forests. These ‘fool’s days’ are ritualistic festivals where ancestors are honoured through elaborate practical jokes. A tanukin might spend weeks creating a trail of owlbear footprints and making illusory ‘hooting’ sounds only to douse the would-be hunters in gallons of skunk scent and paint.

Though they remain within their forests, that does not mean the Tanukin don’t travel. Torii gates allow wayfarers to jump almost instantaneously between Tanukin groves. These portals are often allowed to become densely overgrown, shielding them from the prying eyes of the tall folk who might exploit this jealously guarded secret.
